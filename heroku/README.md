In this lesson, I learned about the cloud platform Heroku. Throughout this lesson, I learned how to create a heroku app and how to deploy it to heroku. The app I made only displays the word "Hello" for now but I will continue experimenting and adding to it.  The link to my heroku app is luroku.herokuapp.com.
